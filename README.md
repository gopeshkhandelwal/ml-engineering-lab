# ml-engineering-lab

A collection of machine learning engineering projects, datasets, and Jupyter notebooks for experimentation, learning, and prototyping.

## Project Structure

- `datasets/` — Contains various CSV and image datasets used in the notebooks.
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks with end-to-end ML workflows, data analysis, and model building.
- `README.md` — Project overview and instructions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd ml-engineering-lab
   ```
2. (Optional) Set up a Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install required packages (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the notebooks in Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/
   ```

## Notebooks

- Each notebook in `notebooks/` is self-contained and documents its own workflow.
- Example topics: bank churn prediction, credit card user churn, food order analysis, support ticket categorization, and more.

## Datasets

- Datasets are provided in the `datasets/` folder and are referenced by the notebooks.
- Most datasets are in CSV format; some are images or Excel files.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request for improvements or new notebooks.
